# Workspace

Cepi is divided into the server jar, [Sabre](https://github.cepi.world/Sabre) (using [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) and all of its extensions.

To install the server + all its extensions, use:

Shell (Mac, Linux)
```bash
curl -fsSL https://installsh.cepi.world | sh
```

Powershell (Windows)
```powershell
iwr "https://installps.cepi.world" | iex
```

## Intellij

Intellij is the reccomended editor for working with any Cepi extension. Eclipse can also be used if preferred, and a kotlin plugin is available to those who need it.

## Gradle

(If you are using Intellij gradle isn't required to be installed) [gradle](https://gradle.org/) is the build tool used for all kotlin-made services on Cepi.
