# Extensions

## KStom

[KStom](https://github.cepi.world/KStom) is the kotlin library for minestom created by Cepi. It is used in any kotlin extension created by [Project-Cepi](https://github.cepi.world).

It contains serializers for [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/kotlin/kotlinx.serialization), raycasting, command utilities + generation by classes, and much more.

## Kepi

[Kepi](https://github.cepi.world/Kepi) is the core for any extension specific to Cepi. It contains useful utilities, data storage handling, and a ][translation manager](translation).

## Making an Extension

If you want to make an entirely new system for Cepi, create a repository based on the [ExampleExtension](https://github.cepi.world/ExampleExtension) repository. The [minestom wiki](https://wiki.minestom.net) is a good place to learn minestom features
