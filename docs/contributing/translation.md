# Translating

Cepi supports all of the minecraft-supported locales in the [Translations](https://github.cepi.world/Translations) repository.

Add a file with locales that you know in a Pull Request to get your language supported in Cepi.

The translation manager can be found in [Kepi](https://github.cepi.world/Kepi)
