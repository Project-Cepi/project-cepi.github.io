# Traps

Traps allow you to make blocks do special actions depending on the interaction of them.

For example, use `/trap create Damage 1` and `/trap apply magma_block 10` 
to apply a Damage trap to all magma blocks in a radius of 10 from you.

## Commands

`/trap create (trapName) (...args)` - Create a trap item (purple dye)

`/trap apply (blockName) (radius)` - Apply a trap item to all blocks of the type in a radius.

## Usages

To use a trap item, simply right click on a block to set its trap.
