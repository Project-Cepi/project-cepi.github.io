# Labs
Labs are places where players can mess around with the tooling with restrictions. 

These are mainly useful if you do not want to mess around with the main world, or are trying to do a quick test in the main cepi instance (cepi.world)

## Usage

To use labs, do `/lab` to create a lab.

 You can use `/lab invite (player)` to invite a player.
