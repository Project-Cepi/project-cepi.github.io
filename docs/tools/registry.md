# Registry

Some systems have a Registry, allowing different items to be stored in the content database. 

For example, the Item System has a registry that allows different items to be stored globally, sharing a global place for all items to be located in.

## Commands

`registry add [<name>]` -- depending on the system, the name may be optional, and this will add an item (method depends on the system) to the registry

`registry get <name>` -- gets an item from the registry

`registry remove <name>` -- removes an item from the registry
