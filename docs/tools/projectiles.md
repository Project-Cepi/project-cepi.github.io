# Projectiles

Projectiles are a subsystem of the mob system, and allow making mobs temporarily in the world with some force applied to them.

This allows for various mob types, like minions or bee cannons.

## Commands

Start making projectiles by using `/projectile create` -- you must be holding a mob egg.

You can shoot a projectile by using right click or `/projectile shoot`.

`/projectile property <property> <arguments...>` Projectiles have many properties and their corresponding arguments, for example:

`/projectile property spread .2` and `/projectile property amount 10` will make a spreaded weapon, similar to a shotgun
